## Overview
This is a solution to the [Audiophile e-commerce website challenge on Frontend Mentor] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). 
 
## The Project Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
 
 
## My process
The project is a hard task and it took me three weeks to complete. It has helped me improve my coding skills by building real projects.

 
## Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
-  React  (https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux
- Material-Ul (https://material-ui.com)
- Javascript
- Firebase
 


## What I learned
The project makes me understand better how powerful React.js. I learnt how to use Bootstrap with React without using React-Bootstrap dependencies and I also understand better how Redux works. I was able 
The Project exposed me to new CSS properties I haven't used before such as transform: translateY(-5rem).


 ## Continued development
I will love to focus more on the Backend and Database for the project and other projects too.

 ## Deployement
I deploy the website on Github and host it on Firebase
